      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        I really enjoyed taking this assessment, after working the past few
        months on an Angular project it was fun to get back to React. I would
        say that I think this is a lot of work to try to accomplish in three
        hours, so I had to cut a few corners. I did not devote enough time to
        testing as I would have liked, but that's probably understandable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feel free to reach out with any questions, and I'm more than happy to
        address whatever madness you might find ðŸ˜œ.
